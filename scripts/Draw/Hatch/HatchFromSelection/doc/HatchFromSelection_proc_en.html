  <li>Prepare the entities that surround the hatching area so they form a
  closed contour. The contour must be closed in a way that one entity is
  connected to the next one as shown at the right in this example:
  <br/>
  <img src="HatchFromSelectionBoundary.png" class="figure"/>
  </li>
  <li>Select the contour(s) you want to fill. Note that islands inside contours
  will get hatched if they are not selected:
  <br/>
  <img src="HatchFromSelectionIslands.png" class="figure"/>
  </li>
  <li>Launch the hatch tool.</li>
  <li>A dialog for the hatch options is displayed. Choose a hatch
  pattern, scale factor and a rotation angle for the hatch pattern. If you want
  to fill the object with a solid color instead of a pattern, check the
  check box "Solid Fill".</li>
  <li>Click 'OK' to proceed with the hatching. Depending on the complexity of
  the contour and the scale factor of the chosen pattern, it might take a while
  to create the hatch.</li>
</ol>
